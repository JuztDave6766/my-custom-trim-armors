## Installation Guide

Follow these simple steps to install this resource pack and transform your armour trims:

1. Download the Pack

    Click the download link for the resource pack on this page.

    Save the downloaded .zip file to an easy-to-find location (like your Desktop). Do not unzip the file.

2. Access the Resource Pack Folder

    Open Minecraft and, from the main menu, go to Options â†’ Resource Packs.

    Click the "Open Pack Folder" button located in the bottom-left corner. This will open the folder where Minecraft looks for resource packs.

3. Move the Pack

    Drag the .zip file you downloaded in Step 1 and drop it directly into the open Resource Pack Folder.

4. Activate the Pack

    Return to Minecraft. If you were in the Resource Pack menu, you might need to click the "Resource Packs" button again for the list to refresh.

    Find the resource pack in the list of Available Packs on the left side.

    Click the arrow icon on the pack's thumbnail to move it to the Selected Packs list on the right.

    Ensure the resource pack is at the top of the Selected Packs list if you are using other packs (to ensure its textures are prioritized).

    Click "Done".

Minecraft will load the pack, and your armour trims will now display the new costume textures!

Note: If you encounter any issues, make sure you are running the correct version of Minecraft for which the resource pack was designed.
